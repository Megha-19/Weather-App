# Weather-App
A React Native App


### How to Use 

This project targets the iOS platforms. Specifically, it targets iPhone 11 X series. Hence, you will need an iPhone to run this prototype. 
 
In order to run this project, you should: 
1. Download the project repository (in .zip file) 
2. Unzip the file and open terminal to navigate to the file’s location. For example, 
after unzipping you’ll need to do: ​ cd path/to/project/repository 
3. Once inside the project repository, you need to run the command: “​npm install​” 
to install all dependencies 
4. After “npm install” completes, you should run the command: “​expo start​” to start 
the app. At this point a new page opens in your laptop’s browser that shows a 
QR code on the left hand side.  
5. After you see the QR code, download the app “​Expo​” from the app store. [​Link​]  
6. After completion, use the iPhone’s camera to point to the QR code and tap the 
pop up that shows up. 
7. Congratulations, you will be redirected to the Weather App on Expo.
